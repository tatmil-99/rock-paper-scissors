## Purpose and Summary

This project was built with the intention of practicing DOM manipulation and event handling. The game is simple, you play against a program which randomly generates a choice of either rock, paper, or scissors. The script listens for a click event on three buttons in the browser, labelled with their respective choice of rock, paper, or scissors. Once clicked, the listener function runs and a series of 5 rounds are played, all whilst the score is logged to the UI in real time. Messages are also logged, providing more details about who has won the round. Once the game is over, a message is displayed saying so and the event listeners are removed from the buttons, preventing the user from further playing. In addition, a professional/collaborative environment is used following Git workflows. The project first existed without a UI, then I iterated by creating a new feature branch for adding a UI and DOM/event handlers. Once the feature branch was complete, I merged with main and pushed to my remote repo, then deleted the feature branch.
